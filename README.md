General Information

This project explores the creation of an original house music track using digital tools and audio effects such as phasing and transposing. It documents the creative and technical process behind developing the beat, melody, and overall sound design. The project addresses the challenge of producing a cohesive and engaging house track as a beginner in digital music production. It aims to solve issues like achieving the right tempo, layering sounds effectively, and understanding how effects like the phaser or transposer influence the overall mix.
The purpose of this project is to learn the fundamentals of electronic music production, experiment with different effects and techniques, and apply coding-based music tools to create a track that captures the energy and rhythm typical of house music. I undertook this project to develop my creative and technical skills in digital sound production. I wanted to understand how producers build house tracks from the ground up — from beat design to melodic structure and to push myself to learn through trial, experimentation, and reflection.

Technologies Used

TunePad is an online platform that lets you create music using Python code. It combines a coding environment with built-in instruments and sounds, so you can program melodies, beats, and effects directly through code

Features

Coded Music Creation – The track is built using Python code in TunePad, allowing control over rhythm, pitch, and effects through programming rather than manual recording.

House Music Structure – The project follows the core elements of house music, including a steady four-on-the-floor beat, layered synths, and a focus on rhythm and groove.

Audio Effects Experimentation – It explores sound effects like bend and transpose, which were used to shape the texture and feel of the music, adding depth and movement to the track.

Setup:

Requirements-

A web browser

A TunePad account 

Internet connection and headphones or speakers to listen to playback

How to start

Go to tunepad.com
 and log in or create an account.

Open a new project or paste in the code from this repository. You can choose to remix my project and tweak it as you like in your own copy

Press the play icon to play the music and experiment with the sounds.

You can edit tempo, notes, and effects  directly in the code to hear changes instantly.


Usage:

You can use this project to experiment with creating and editing your own house music beats using code on TunePad. Here's a sample of my drum pattern used thats central to my beat

rest(beats = 0.5)


playNote(4, beats = 0.25) 

playNote(4, beats = 0.25)

rest(beats = 0.5)

playNote(4)

playNote(4)

playNote(4, beats = 0.5)

Project Status

Project is complete, song finishes at beat 212 but may continue on its own.

Room for Improvement:


1: Smoother transitions within stages of breakdowns and build ups

2: More experience with pitch control and range in order to make sure instruments sound blended and to save time writing lines of code.

To do:

Actual end of song. (I chose to state song stops at beat 212 but the code runs infinitely which I couldn't fix in time)

Better Piano that mixes well with the drums and bass, sounds too thrown in.
